# `Neo4j` GraphDB Implementation

This section details the Neo4j implementation of the `BaseGraphDB` interface. The implementation is structured into several subclasses, each handling a specific group of methods from the `BaseGraphDB` interface. These subclasses are then inherited by the **`Neo4jGraphInterface`**, which serves as a unified interface for interacting with the Neo4j implementation.
